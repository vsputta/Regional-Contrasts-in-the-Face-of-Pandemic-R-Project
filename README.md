Regional Contrasts in the Face of Pandemic: A Thorough Exploration of COVID-19 Impact Across U.S. Regions

Synopsis
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had a profound global impact. This project delves into the regional variations of COVID-19 effects across U.S. regions, focusing on death per case ratios as a primary metric. The objective is to assess the prevalence of cases and severity of outcomes, followed by a statistical analysis using correlation coefficients to provide robust insights.

Objective :
Conduct a comparative analysis of COVID-19 impact across U.S. regions.
Utilize death per case ratios as the primary metric.
Rate regions based on both case prevalence and severity of outcomes.
Perform statistical analysis using correlation coefficients.

Data Preparation : 
The project utilizes the US COVID-19 data until 01/13/2021 from The New York Times GitHub repository. The dataset is cleaned and processed to create a tidy format for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis : 
Scattering of total cases over U.S. states.
Analysis of total cases and deaths by region on the last date.
Calculation and visualization of Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for top states.
Exploration of CFR by region and statistical analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Correlation analysis between average CFR, total cases, and total deaths in U.S. regions.

Summary : 
The South region leads in both total COVID-19 cases and deaths.
North Dakota in the North Central region has the highest CFR.
Weak negative correlation between average CFR and total cases.
Moderate to strong positive correlation between average CFR and total deaths, and between total cases and total deaths.

Limitations : 
Data limitations, potential inaccuracies, and lack of consideration for population dynamics.
Fixed time frame, variability in policies and reporting, and regional heterogeneity.
